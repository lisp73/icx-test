You can run the program as follows:
Run "lein ring server" on your command line. (This should bring up a browser with a localhost:3000
To load the data, go to http://localhost:3000/load (This will transfer the csv data to json data. You can see the json file in "data/output.json"
You can also see the json data in http://localhost:3000/load/show uri as well. 
I wrote the front end using ClojureScript, the following are instructions to run it:
run lein ring server on one command line and then lein cljsbuild auto on another command line while the server is running. 
Go to localhost:3000/index.html and there you will see the ClojureScript content. 
The following instruction are for seeing the content of the program via curl
You can also navigate the program via curl, here are the instructions:
run lein ring server
Once the servers running, on the terminal, put following commands:
curl -i http://localhost:3000/load
curl -i http://localhost:3000/load/show
curl -i http://localhost:3000/load/index.html
